The project is a JavaScript-based implementation of the classic 2048 game. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, where the player can slide numbered tiles in four directions (up, down, left, and right). When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a tile with a value that is the sum of their original values. The goal of the game is to reach the tile with the value of 2048.

Technologies Used:

HTML
SCSS (Sass)
